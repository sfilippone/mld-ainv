PREREQUISITES

To build this code you need to have PSBLAS 3.1 or later from
http://www.ce.uniroma2.it/psblas,  and MLD2P4
2.0-beta or later from http://www.mld2p4.it, together with their
prerequisites.  

We provide an interface to the AINV code by M. Tuma, and specifically
the code for sainvsr
http://www2.cs.cas.cz/~tuma/sparslab/sainvsr.tar.gz
to enable you have to download the code from Tuma's website and unpack
it. The sainvsr_driver.F file contains all the code for the ainvsr2
method, together with a  sample main program; you have to take out the
main program and compile ainvsr2 with all its support subroutines.
